Personal blog and notes.

About

I live in Mount Vernon, WA, and work on data applications and pipelines at Starbucks, handling cloud services to move data from store registers to backend systems. I enjoy programming, technology, and sharing insights on .NET, web development, and more.

Recent work includes updating shared code NuGet packages for .NET 9, and past projects with Aurelia, ASP.NET Core, and Windows development.

Interests: Software development, cloud computing, open source contributions.
